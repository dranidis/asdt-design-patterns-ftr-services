## Which design patterns are implied in the code in Main.java?

ANSWER: Write text here

## Write Java code for all interfaces/classes you find necessary so that the Main compiles and when it executes it prints the expected results. (see Main.java) 		

Your answer should be the Java files in the repo.

## Draw a class diagram of the necessary classes/interfaces and their relationships.
